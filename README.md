# FastAPI Project

## Purpose

This FastAPI project is designed for processing and analyzing web traffic data. The main objectives include:

1. **Extracting Content from URLs**: Provide an API to retrieve and process content from specified web URLs.
2. **Processing PDF Documents**: Handle PDF uploads and extract relevant content for further analysis.
3. **Facilitating Chat Interactions**: Enable users to ask questions related to the processed content.
4. **Traffic Data Analysis**: Analyze user interaction data from a CSV file to derive insights about events, geographical distribution, and popular content.

## Code Explanation

### Main Application

The application is built using FastAPI, which provides a modern web framework for building APIs with Python.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from services import process_url, process_pdf, chat_with_content

app = FastAPI()
```

### Data Models

#### URLRequest

This model validates requests for processing URLs, allowing optional parameters like HTTP method and headers.

```python
class URLRequest(BaseModel):
    url: str
    method: str = 'GET'  # Default value
    headers: dict = None  # Optional field
```

#### ChatRequest

This model is used for chat interactions, requiring a chat ID and a question.

```python
class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    chat_id: str
    question: str
```

### API Endpoints

1. **Process URL**
   - **Endpoint**: `/process_url`
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Functionality**: Accepts a URL and processes its content, returning a unique chat ID.

2. **Process PDF**
   - **Endpoint**: `/process_pdf`
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Functionality**: Accepts a PDF file, checks its validity, and processes it to extract content.

3. **Chat**
   - **Endpoint**: `/chat`
   - **Method**: `POST`
   - **Functionality**: Facilitates chat interactions based on processed content.

### Traffic Data Analysis

The project includes functionality for analyzing traffic data from a CSV file using pandas. Key steps include:

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv("traffic.csv")
   ```

2. **Output Extraction**:
   - Displaying the first few rows and columns of the dataset.
   - Counting total events, daily events, and geographical distributions.
   - Identifying the most popular artists and albums.

3. **Results**:
   - Total Events: `226278`
   - Daily Event Counts: 
     ```
     2021-08-19    35361
     2021-08-20    34112
     ...
     ```
   - Country Distribution: Most events from Saudi Arabia and India.
   - Unique Links Accessed: `3839`

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Grouping events by artist and link ID to analyze interactions.

### Deployment

The application can be deployed on any platform that supports Python and FastAPI, such as:

- **Heroku**
- **AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda)**
- **DigitalOcean**
- **Google Cloud Platform**

To run the application locally, use Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive framework for processing web content, facilitating chat interactions, and analyzing traffic data. It leverages FastAPI for efficient API development and pandas for data analysis, making it a robust solution for web traffic insights.
